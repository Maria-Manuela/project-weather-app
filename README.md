# Weather App

Weather application with the city origin Herning

## The problem

During this project, I encountered some challenges, particularly with managing branches and handling API keys. Despite my efforts, I struggled to fetch the correct data and encountered issues with the API key. I spent a lot of time trying various approaches, but nothing seemed to work. Eventually, I decided to seek guidance from another weather app to help me move forward.

If I had more time, I would have dedicated additional effort to understanding how to work more effectively with APIs and resolve the issues independently.

FYI The original repository where i had 20 commits and tried to work with branches have been deleted and clone the projects again and transfer the work here. Therfore, not so many commits available will be present to see the work process, as I couldÂ´t find another solution.
